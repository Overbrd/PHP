								<h2>Delray Computer (2006-2016)</h2>
								<p>I was the owner and sole-proprietor of the company while helping to raise a family of four. Delray Computer was licensed and insured, used only legally-bought hardware and software, and conducted only legitimate and legal business and operated legally, morally, and ethically. In the 10 years I was in business I had no law suits, no BBB complaints, and no refunds were ever requested. I managed multiple projects simultaneously and was the primary contact and deliverer for all projects.</p>
								<p>Stakeholders were real estate agents and brokers, corporations, small business owners and the general public.</p>
